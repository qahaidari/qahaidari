- 👋 Hi, I’m @qahaidari.
- 👀 I’m interested in radar systems for automotive applications, radar signal processing and algorithm development, embedded systems development, machine learning and computer vision for self-driving car applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deployment of ML applications to cloud using Docker and AWS, computer vision and CNN applications for self driving cars, radar algorithms for object detection in automotive vehicles, and sensor fusion for self-driving cars. I am also making use of any opportunity to improve my programming skills in C/C++ and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above mentioned topics.
